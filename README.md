# DISTRHO OneKnob Series

A collection of stupidly simple but well-polished and visually pleasing audio plugins,
with as little controls as possible,
often just one knob and a few options.

This collection currently includes:<br/>
 - Compressor

The guidelines for the collection are:
 - Must have one main control/knob (linear or logarithmic), with one auxiliary control/knob allowed but discouraged
 - Can have maximum 3 auxiliary options (list of values or toggles)
 - DSP must be click-free
 - GUI must be cleanly scalable (no bitmaps allowed or blurred resources when scaled)
 - GUI must follow the same style
